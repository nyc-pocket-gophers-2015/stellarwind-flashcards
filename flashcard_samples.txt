begin

Gives an unconditional termination to a code block, and is usually placed with an argument.
break

case

Opens a class definition block, which can later be reopened and added to with variables and even functions.
class

Used to define a function.
def

A boolean logic function that asks whether or not a targeted expression refers to anything recognizable in Ruby; i.e. literal object, local variable that has been initialized, method name visible from the current scope, etc.
defined?

Paired with end, this can delimit a code block, much like curly braces; however, curly braces retain higher precedence.
do

Gives an "otherwise" within a function, if-statement, or for-loop, i.e. if cats = cute, puts "Yay!" else puts "Oh, a cat.”
else

Much like else, but has a higher precedence, and is usually paired with terms.
